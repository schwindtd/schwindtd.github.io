I am currently a Ph.D. student in the Economics Department at the University of Maryland, College Park (UMD). My interests center on macroeconomics, finance, and economic history. Prior to my Ph.D. studies, I worked in Market Risk at Morgan Stanley and as a research assistant at the Federal Reserve Board. I received my Bachelors in Mathetmatical Economics from Wake Forest University. I'm originally from Central Flordia (not too far from Disney World) and love swimming and playing clarinet.

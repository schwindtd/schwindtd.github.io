I am currently a research associate at Cornerstone Research in Washington, DC. My interests center on banking, finance, risk management, macroeconomics, and economic history. 

Prior to joining Cornerstone Research, I worked in policy development at the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. I received my Masters in Economics from the University of Maryland, College Park. Prior to my graduate studies, I worked in Market Risk at Morgan Stanley and as a research assistant at the Federal Reserve Board. I received my Bachelors in Mathematical Economics from Wake Forest University. I'm originally from Central Florida (not too far from Disney World) and love swimming and playing clarinet.

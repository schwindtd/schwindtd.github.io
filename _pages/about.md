I am currently a 2nd year Economics Ph.D. student at the University of Maryland, College Park (UMD). My interests center on macroeconomics, finance, and economic history. Prior to entering the Ph.D. program at UMD I worked in Market Risk at Morgan Stanley and as a research assistant at the Federal Reserve Board.
